### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nathalie Aoun (She/Her/Hers) and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Lowe-Power lab at the Plant Pathology Department at UC Davis.
My postdoc project aim to identify adaptive genes used by _Ralstonia_ to infect plant species with different levels of quantitative disease response and from different botanical families. _Ralstonia_ are generalist bacteria, they can infect around 396 plant species from diverse botanical families. The ability of these bacteria to cross the species barrier and infect different plant hosts is facinating. To identify _Ralstonia_ adaptive genes to plant hosts I use two main orthologous approaches: i) the Random Barcoded Transposon mutant sequencing approach (Georgoulis et al., 2021) and ii) the genome-wide association mapping approach.  

Background:
I obtained my Ph.D. in Plants-Microorganisms interactions at the LIPME-INRAE of Toulouse (France). During my Ph.D. I worked on identifying and characterizing the genetic basis of the natural variation of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ disease response to _Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum_ under heat stress. 

Iâ€™m fascinated by plant-bacterial interactions and how both partners co-evolve under changing environments. Plants adapt to bacterial infections and activate complex mechanisms to defend themselves (Aoun et al., 2017; 2020; Desaint, Aoun et al., 2021). Bacteria also adapt to host species and use defense- and non-defense related genes to infect plants.
